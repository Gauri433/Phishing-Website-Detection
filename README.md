# **Phishing Detection Using CNN-BiLSTM with Meta-Learning**

## **Overview**
Phishing attacks are a prevalent cybersecurity threat, leading to financial losses and stolen personal data. This project provides a deep learning-based system to detect phishing websites with high accuracy. It leverages a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model, enhanced with meta-learning, to distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones effectively. The system is integrated into a user-friendly Flask web application that allows users to paste URLs and check their authenticity.
